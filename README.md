# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple Python chatbot that responds to specific user inputs using basic if-elif logic.

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script `chatbot.py` in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```
3. When prompted, type one of the following:
   - `hello`
   - `how are you`
   - `bye`

Any other input will result in the chatbot responding with "I don't understand that."

## Example Outputs

| User Input         | Chatbot Output             |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| hello              | Hi!                       |
| how are you        | I'm fine, thanks!         |
| bye                | Goodbye!                  |
| (anything else)    | I don't understand that.  |
